            <p class="sm-text-justify">Software development is a dance between today’s needs and tomorrow’s solutions.
              With this in mind, Adam Parrish founded Neosavvy in 2008 to help clients
              understand their own needs, to develop and deploy software solutions that
              fit those needs, and to train clients with the technical knowledge and
              skills required to implement future solutions.</p>
            <p class="sm-text-justify">In addition to tailoring software solutions that fit your practical and
              aesthetic needs, we offer training, consulting, and project planning, delivery,
              and management services.</p>
            <p class="sm-text-justify">To stay at the forefront of software development, you need dynamic, practical,
              and adaptable knowledge. That’s why we implement collaborative project
              management strategies—from the front to back and start to finish—that benefit
              the client and the developer. We learn from every project we deploy and
              help you do the same.</p>
            <p class="sm-text-justify">We also consider ourselves active members of the development community
              at Neosavvy. In a collaborative spirit, we strive to share with others
              what we learn from our work because smarter developers are better developers.
              This is also why we have high standards (and great benefits) for our Neosavvy
              employees.</p>
            <p class="sm-text-justify">We have the capability to provide solutions for every step of your project.
              How can we help you today?</p>

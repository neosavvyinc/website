              We’re looking for developers with technical aptitude and the people skills
              to match. It’s important that everyone on our team takes an iterative,
              client-centric approach to projects. We also want team members to have
              effective communication skills, be adaptable and flexible, and constantly
              strive for on-time continuous deployment.
            </p>

            <h3 className="title is-3">About you</h3>
            <p>
              You can demonstrate a solid understanding of full stack
              development in HTML/CSS/Javascript hooked into a Scala, Java, Python or
              Rails JSON/REST-ful API. You (like us) currently focus on Javascript frontend development,
              but also have an interest in projects with Scala, Java, or Python backends exposed
              as REST-ful services.
            </p>

            <h3 className="title is-3">About us</h3>
            <p>
              We’re proud of the work we do at Neosavvy. It’s dynamic,
              engaging and challenges us to learn, do, and share more. We
              provide software solutions that fit our clients’ practical
              and aesthetic needs. We offer training, consulting, project
              planning, delivery, and management services.
            </p>
            <p>
              We consider ourselves active members of the engineering community.
              In a collaborative spirit, we strive to share with others what
              we learn from our work. This is also why we have high standards
              (and great benefits) for our Neosavvy employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              All Neosavvy team members earn competitive salaries, receive free
              lunches, and participation in company sponsored events.
